In a RAG system, a generator network is trained to produce text given a prompt, while a retriever network is trained to retrieve relevant text from a large corpus to augment the generator's output. This combination of generative and retrieval capabilities allows the RAG system to generate more coherent and contextually relevant text than either approach alone. RAG systems have been shown to be particularly effective in natural language understanding and have been used in various applications such as question answering, machine translation, and video understanding.\"},\n",
