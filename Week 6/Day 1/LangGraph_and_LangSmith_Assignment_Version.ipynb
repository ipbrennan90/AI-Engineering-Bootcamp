        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

It involves backpropagating gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). The QLoRA paper titled \"QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs\" was authored by Tim Dettmers, Artidoro Pagnoni, Ari Holtzman, and Luke Zettlemoyer.

Long Range Communication: LoRa technology allows devices to communicate over long distances, up to several kilometers in urban areas and even tens of kilometers in rural areas. This extended range is ideal for applications that require communication over large geographic areas.\\n\\n2. Low Power Consumption: LoRa devices are designed to operate on low power, making them suitable for battery-operated IoT devices. The low power consumption of LoRa technology enables devices to have long battery life, reducing the need for frequent battery replacements.\\n\\n3. Scalability: The LoRa system is highly scalable, allowing for the deployment of a large number of devices within a single network. This scalability makes it suitable for IoT applications that require connectivity for a large number of devices spread across a wide area.\\n\\n4. Cost-Effective: LoRa technology is cost-effective compared to other communication technologies, making it a preferred choice for IoT applications that require long-range communication at a lower cost.\\n\\n5. Secure Communication: LoRa technology provides secure communication through encryption and authentication mechanisms, ensuring that data transmitted between devices is protected from unauthorized access.\\n\\n6. Flexibility: The LoRa system offers flexibility in terms of deployment options, allowing for both public and private network deployments. This flexibility enables organizations to choose the deployment model that best suits their requirements.\\n\\nOverall, the LoRa system's significant improvements in long-range communication, low power consumption, scalability, cost-effectiveness, security, and flexibility make it a popular choice for IoT applications that require reliable and efficient connectivity.\",\n",

Fine tuning is the process of tailoring a machine learning model to a specific application, which can be vital in achieving consistent and high quality performance. Let's jump on LoRA. Low-Rank Adaptation of LLMs (LoRA) So, in usual fine-tuning, we. Take a pretrained model. Do Transfer Learning over new training data to slightly adjust these pre-trained weights And that is the aim of LoRA — to take the change-in-weight matrix and approximate it with the product of two lower-rank matrices. ...

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a machine learning technique that modifies a pretrained model (for example, an LLM or vision transformer) to better suit a specific, often smaller, dataset by adjusting only a small, low-rank subset of the model's parameters. This approach is important because it allows for efficient finetuning of ...\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through ... Allen School Ph.D. student Tim Dettmers accepted the grand prize for QLoRA, a novel approach to finetuning pretrained models that significantly reduces the amount of GPU memory required — from over 780GB to less than 48GB — to finetune a 65B parameter model.

QLoRA: One of the core contributions of bitsandbytes towards the democratization of AI. Tim Dettmers: So for the purpose of training or fine tuning we just quantized the base model because that's very, very expensive, the low rank adapters, so to ensure training stability are still in higher precision. Steve Hsu: Okay. And, and what you found is that again, fairly aggressive quantization still allows for good results.\n",

            "Tool Response: The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones. The Machine learning-based attention method simulates how human attention works by assigning varying levels of importance to different words in a sentence. It assigns importance to each word by calculating \"soft\" weights for the word's numerical representation, known as its embedding, within a specific section of the sentence called the context window to determine its importance. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences. For instance, consider translating a sentence from one language to another. Translating a sentence word-by-word is usually not an option because it ignores the complex grammatical ...
